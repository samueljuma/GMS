# Gym Management System (GMS)

The **Gym Management System (GMS)** is a backend API built with **Django** and **Django REST Framework (DRF)**. It provides a robust solution for managing gym operations, including user management, subscription plans, attendance tracking, and payment processing. The system is designed with scalability, security, and maintainability in mind.

## Features
### 1. User Management
- **Roles**: Users can have one of three roles:
  - **Admin**: Full access to manage users, subscriptions, payments, and attendance.
  - **Trainer**: Manage members, mark attendance, and record payments.
  - **Member**: View their profile, attendance, and payment history.
- **Authentication**: Secure JWT-based authentication with tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies.
- **Registration**:
  - Members can self-register.
  - Admins and Trainers can add new users.
- **Approval Workflow**:
  - Self-registered users require approval by Admins or Trainers.

### 2. Subscription Management
- **Plans**: Admins can create, update, and delete subscription plans (e.g., daily, monthly).
- **Subscriptions**: Members can subscribe to plans. Subscriptions are tracked with start and end dates.

### 3. Attendance Tracking
- Trainers or Admins can mark attendance for members.
- Prevents duplicate attendance records for the same day.

### 4. Payment Processing
- **Payment Methods**:
  - **M-Pesa**: Mobile payment integration using STK Push.
  - **Cash**: Manual payment recording.
  - **Other**: Easily extendable to support other payment methods.
- **Payment Records**: Tracks payment details including amount, method, and status.

### 5. Role-Based Access Control
- Permissions are enforced at both view and object levels.
- Ensures users can only access resources relevant to their roles.

### 6. Error Handling
- Provides standardized error responses.
- Custom exception handler and renderer used across the system.
